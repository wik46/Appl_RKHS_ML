# Appl_RKHS_ML
What is the best Kernel? I want to compare the Szego kernel to currently used kernels such as linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels in SVM.

## KernelMethodHardy
This directory will be used for specific examples using the Szego kernel.

## Tools
This will be where I store packages of code that I reuse frequently.

## Tutorials
This will be examples where I study how everything works. This will not be my own code but a lot of tutorials from textbooks and such.
